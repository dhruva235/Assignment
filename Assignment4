1. What exactly is []?
empty list


2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value hello as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
spam = [2,4,6,8,10]
spam.insert(2,"hello")
print(spam)


Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a','b','c','d'] for the next three queries.



3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3'* 2) / 11)]?
d
4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
d
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
['a', 'b']

Let pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat',11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index([cat])?
1
7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove(cat) change the look of the list in bacon?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]


9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
append add values at the end
insert will add values at specified index

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
pop()
remove()

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
The similarity between Lists and Strings in Python is that both are sequences


13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
1.Lists are mutable and Tuples are immutable
2.Implication of iterations is Time-consuming   in tupelThe implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3.The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.	Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements


14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
int

15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?
tuple(x) is an iterator to convert iterative objects to tuple and list_data is the input data
data = [tuple(x) for x in name]

16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
they can contain any data type 

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
In case of deep copy, a copy of object is copied in other object. It means that any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the original object. In python

in cop original object will change
